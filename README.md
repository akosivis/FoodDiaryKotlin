# FoodDiaryKotlin
A personal app intended for saving information of your daily food intake.

This app is primarily created as a way for me to track the food that I have eaten daily as I am suffering from occasional acid reflux a few months ago. I also created this app to reinforce specific concepts in Android app architecture that I am currently trying to learn such as ViewModels, Room database, Coroutines and View Binding.  

Features:
- Add an food item and its details (name, food item's specific ingredients)
- View all the food item history by date
- View the three latest food items added to the app
- Date range selection for generation of food list 

Features that are yet to be implemented:
- Modify details of food items
- Successful retrieval of food list items given a date range selected by the user
- PDF file generation for food list certain food list items 
- Overall app theme
